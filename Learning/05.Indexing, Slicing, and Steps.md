# Indexing 
[1] All Data in Python is Object
[2] Object Contain Elements
[3] Every Element Has Its Own Index
[4] Python Use Zero Based Indexing ( Index Start From Zero )
[5] Use Square Brackets To Access Element []
[6] Enable Accessing Parts Of Strings, Tuples or Lists
```python 
a = "I Love Python"
print(a.index("P")) # Index Number 7 # Method
print (a.index ("P", 0, 10)) # Index from 0 to 10 # Method
print(a[0]) # Normal Indexing
```
# Slicing
      print (myString[8:11])
 
 # Steps
      print (myString[::2])
 
Indexing is used to access a single element of the sequence.
Slicing is used to access a subset or range of elements from the sequence.
the index method [index()] is used to find the `first occurrence` of a specified value
(it's position) within the sequence.
You can also specify the start and end points for the search within the string. 
``` a.index("P", 0, 10) ```
To find `all occurrences` of a specified value in a sequence like a list or a string in Python, 
youâ€™ll need to write a loop or use a list comprehension [Advanced].
