# Formatting the placeholder in new ways
curly brackets {} and the value is like this: 
```py 
myName = "Osama"
myAge = 36
print(f"My Name is : {myName} and My Age is : {myAge}") # output: My Name is : Osama and My Age is : 36
```
# Truncate String
remove some stuff from a string and leave what i want.
```py 
original_string = "Hello, World!"
truncated_string = original_string[:5]
print(truncated_string) #output: Hello
```
# The difference between truncating string and slicing
`Slicing a String:`
Slicing is a more general concept. It involves taking a substring from a string, 
specified by a range of indices. You can slice from any point to any other point in the string, not just from the beginning.
For example, my_string[1:5] takes the substring from index 1 to index 4 (the character at index 5 is not included).
Slicing can be used to extract any part of a string, not necessarily for shortening it.
`Truncating a String:`
Truncating specifically refers to shortening a string, typically from the beginning to a certain length. 
It’s a specific case of slicing where you always start at the beginning of the string and end at a specified index.
For example, my_string[:5] truncates the string to the first 5 characters.
The term `Truncating` is often used in contexts where there’s a need to limit the string length, like in UI display, 
while maintaining the start of the string.
# Format Money
```py 
{:,}
``` 
puts comma after 3 digits
```py 
myMoney = 500162350198
print("My Money in Bank Is: {}" .format (myMoney)) #output: My Money in Bank Is: 500162350198
print("My Money in Bank Is: {:,}" .format (myMoney)) #output: My Money in Bank Is: 500,162,350,198
```
:: **VIP NOTE** ::
you cannot mix the f-string with `.format() method`
let's take the two examples we previously mentioned 
Example 1
```py 
myName = "Osama"
myAge = 36
print(f"My Name is : {myName} and My Age is : {myAge}") # output: My Name is : Osama and My Age is : 36
```
putting the f-string didn't raise an error, while in this example
```py 
myMoney = 500162350198
print("My Money in Bank Is: {}" .format (myMoney)) #output: My Money in Bank Is: 500162350198
print("My Money in Bank Is: {:,}" .format (myMoney)) #output: My Money in Bank Is: 500,162,350,198
```
if we put an f-string like this: 
```py 
myMoney = 500162350198
print(f"My Money in Bank Is: {}" .format (myMoney)) #through error
print(f"My Money in Bank Is: {:,}" .format (myMoney)) #through error
```
In these lines, you’re using f at the start, indicating an f-string, 
but then you’re also trying to use the .format() method. These are two 
different styles of string formatting, and they cannot be mixed in this way. 
The {} inside an f-string expects a variable or expression directly inside it, not a later .format() method call.
:: **to fix the second example** ::
```py 
myMoney = 500162350198
print(f"My Money in Bank Is: {myMoney}") #output: My Money in Bank Is: 500162350198
print(f"My Money in Bank Is: {myMoney:,}") #output: My Money in Bank Is: 500,162,350,198
```
