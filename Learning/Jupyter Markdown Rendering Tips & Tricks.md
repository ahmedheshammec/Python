1. Headings: You can use the `#` symbol to create headings of different levels. The more `#` symbols you use, the smaller the heading becomes. For example:

   ```markdown
   # Heading 1
   ## Heading 2
   ### Heading 3
   ```

   The `#` character before the heading text determines the level and size of the heading.

2. Inline Code: Wrap your text within backticks (\`). This is useful when referring to code or displaying code snippets within the text.

3. Bold and Italics: Use asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`) to add emphasis. For example:

   ```markdown
   **Bold Text**
   *Italicized Text*
   ```

4. Links: You can create hyperlinks by using square brackets `[]` for the link text and parentheses `()` for the target URL. For example:

   ```markdown
   [Google](https://www.google.com)
   ```

5. Lists: You can create ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted) lists using either numbers (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) or dashes (`-`, `*`). For example:

   ```markdown
   1. First item
   2. Second item
   - Unordered item 1
   - Unordered item 2
   ```

6. Images: You can include images in Markdown cells using the `![Alt Text](image_url)` syntax. Replace `Alt Text` with the alternative text for the image and `image_url` with the URL or file path of the image.

These are just a few examples of Markdown formatting options that can be rendered differently in Jupyter Notebook. There are several other Markdown features you can use, such as:

7. Code Blocks: Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to display code blocks with syntax highlighting. You can specify the language after the opening backticks for language-specific syntax highlighting. For example:

   \```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   \```

8. Tables: Create tables using the pipe (`|`) and hyphen (`-`) characters. You can also specify text alignment within the table. For example:

   ```markdown
   | Column 1 | Column 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | Content  | Content  |
   | Content  | Content  |
   ```

9. Horizontal Lines: Use three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`) on a separate line to create a horizontal line.

10. Blockquotes: Prefix a line with the `>` symbol to create a blockquote. It is commonly used for citations, notes, or highlighting important information.

11. Math Equations: You can write mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax within Markdown cells. Surround the equation with single dollar signs (`$equation$`) for inline rendering or double dollar signs (`$$equation$$`) for display rendering.

These are just a few examples of Markdown features available in Jupyter Notebook. You can experiment and explore additional Markdown elements and syntax to add more formatting and structure to your content.

Raycast AI: Certainly! Here are a few more Markdown features that you can use in Jupyter Notebook to render your content differently:

1. Strikethrough: Use two tilde (`~~`) characters to strike through text. For example:

   ```markdown
   ~~Strikethrough Text~~
   ```

2. Code Highlighting: Surround a code snippet with backticks and specify the language after the opening backticks to apply syntax highlighting. For example:

   \```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   \```

3. Footnotes: You can add footnotes to your Markdown cells using the `[^footnote]` syntax. For example:
   
   ```markdown
   This is some text with a footnote.[^1] Here is another sentence.

   [^1]: This is the footnote content.
   ```

4. Task Lists: Create checkboxes for task lists by using the dash (`-`) character followed by a space and `[ ]` for an incomplete task or `[x]` for a completed task. For example:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] Task 1
   - [x] Task 2
   ```

5. Keyboard Keys: Use the `<kbd>` element to represent keyboard keys or key combinations. For example:

   ```markdown
   Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy.
   ```

6. Superscript and Subscript: You can use the caret (`^`) symbol for superscript and underscore (`_`) for subscript. For example:

   ```markdown
   H<sub>2</sub>O (water) is made up of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions.
   ```

These additional Markdown features expand on the formatting options available in Jupyter Notebook. You can mix and match these elements to create rich content with different styles, formatting, and interactivity within Jupyter Notebook Markdown cells. Feel free to experiment and combine these features to create visually appealing and informative notebooks!
