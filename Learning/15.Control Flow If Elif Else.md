# Control Flow If Elif Else
Control Flow And Make Decision, let's say there's a course discount only for Egyptians 
```py 
uName = "Osama"
uCountry = "Egypt"
uName = "Python Course"
cPrice = 100
if uCountry == "Egypt":
    print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry}")
    print(f"The Course \"{uName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 80}")
else:
    print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry}")
    print(f"The Course \"{uName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 30}")
 ```
 <!-- outout
Hello Python Course Because You Are From Egypt
The Course "Python Course" Price Is: $20
 -->
now what if i want to make the discount for Egyptians and Saudis 
```py 
uName = "Osama"
uCountry = "Ksa"
cName = "Python Course"
cPrice = 100
if uCountry == "Egypt":
 print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry}")
 print(f"The Course \"{uName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 80}")
elif uCountry == "Ksa":
 print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry}")
 print(f"The Course \"{cName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 70}")
else:
 print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry}")
 print(f"The Course \"{cName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 30}")
 ```
 <!-- output
Hello Osama Because You Are From Ksa
The Course "Python Course" Price Is: $30
-->
::**Note**::: you can repeat the elif for as much as you want
# Nested If
if condition inside if condition 
```py 
uName = "Osama"
uCountry = "Egypt"
cName = "Python Course"
cPrice = 100
if uCountry == "Egypt":
 print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry} and student")
 print(f"The Course \"{uName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 80}")
elif uCountry == "Ksa":
 print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry}")
 print(f"The Course \"{cName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 70}")
else:
 print(f"Hello {uName} Because You Are From {uCountry}")
 print(f"The Course \"{cName}\" Price Is: ${cPrice - 30}")
 ```
<!-- output 
Hello Osama Because You Are From Egypt and student
The Course "Osama" Price Is: $20
-->
#### Ternary Conditional Operator
short if condition
:: **Sytnax** ::
`Condition If True | If Condition | Else | Condition If False`
:: **Example** ::
```py 
movieRate = 18
age = 18
print("Movie S Not Good 4U" if age < movieRate else "Movie S Good 4U And Happy Watching")
```
<!-- output
Movie S Good 4U And Happy Watching
-->
### Calculate Age Advanced Version
```py 
# -------------------------------------------------
# -- Calculate Age Advanced Version and Training --
# -------------------------------------------------

# Write A Very Beautiful Note
print("#" * 80)
print(" You Can Write The First Letter Or Full Name of The Time Unit ".center(80, '#'))
print("#" * 80)

# Collect Age Data
age = input("Please Write Your Age ").strip()

# Collect Time Unit Data
unit = input("Please Choose Time Unit: Months, Weeks, Days ").strip().lower()

# Get Time Units
months = int(age) * 12
weeks = months * 4
days = int(age) * 365

if unit == 'months'or unit == 'm':

 print("You Choosed The Unit Months")
 print(f"You Lived For {months:,} Months.")

elif unit == 'weeks'or unit == 'w':

 print("You Choosed The Unit Weeks")
 print(f"You Lived For {weeks:,} Weeks.")

elif unit == 'days'or unit == 'd':

 print("You Choosed The Unit Days")
 print(f"You Lived For {days:,} Days.")
 ```
 <!-- the output
