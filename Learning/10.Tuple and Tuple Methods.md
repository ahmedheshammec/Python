# Tuple = (1, 2 , 3, 4)
[1] Tuple Items Are Enclosed in Parentheses
[2] You Can Remove The Parentheses If You Want  
[3] Tuple items are Ordered, Use Index To Access Item
[4] Tuple Are Immutable => You Cant Add or Delete
[5] Tuple Items Is Not Unique (same as list)
[6] Tuple Can Have Different Data Types
[7] Operators Used in Strings and Lists Available In Tuples
# Tuple Methods
`count()` just as with lists, to count the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.
```py 
a = (1, 3, 7, 8, 2, 6, 5, 8)
print(a.count(8)) #output: 2
```
`index()` the following code will through error
```py 
b = (1, 3, 7, 8, 2, 6, 5)
print("The Position of Index Is: " + b.index(7)) # Error
```
can't concatenate str to integer so we will use formatting
```py 
b = (1, 3, 7, 8, 2, 6, 5)
print("The Position of Index Is: {:d}". format(b. index(7))) #output: The Position of Index Is: 2
print(f"The Position of Index Is: {b.index(7)}") #output: The Position of Index Is: 2
```
# Tuple Destruct
also known as tuple unpacking, is a convenient feature in Python that allows
you to assign each item of a tuple (or list) to a separate variable in a concise
and readable way. This is particularly useful when you want to break down the elements
of a tuple into individual components.
```py 
a = ("А", "В", 4, "C")
x, y, _, z= a
print(x) #output: А
print(y) #output: В
print(z) #output: C
```
the `_,` ignores [Destruct] value in Tuple
