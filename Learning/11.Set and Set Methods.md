# Set Methods
`clear()` used to remove all items from a set.
```py 
a = {11, 2, 3}
a.clear()
print(a) #output: set()
```
`union()` used with sets to return a set that contains all the elements from the sets
it is combining, without any duplicates. This method can be applied to two or more sets.
```py 
b = {"One", "Two", "Three"}
c = {"1", "2","3"}
print(b | c) #output: {'2', 'Three', 'One', 'Two', '1', '3'}
```
:: **Another Example** ::
```py 
b = {"One", "Two", "Three"}
c = {"1", "2", "3"}
x = {"Zero", "Cool"}
print(b | c) #output: {'1', 'Three', '2', '3', 'One', 'Two'}
print (b.union (c, x)) #output: {'1', 'Zero', 'Cool', 'Three', '2', '3', 'One', 'Two'}
print(b | c | x) #output: {'1', 'Zero', 'Cool', 'Three', '2', '3', 'One', 'Two'}
```
`add()` used with sets to add a single element to the set.
```py 
d = {1, 2, 3, 4}
d.add(5)
d.add(6)
print(d) #output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```
`copy()` used to create a shallow copy of a set. This means that 
it creates a new set that contains the same elements as the original
set, but they are two distinct objects. Changing the contents of 
the copied set will not affect the original set and vice versa.
```py 
e = {1, 2, 3, 4}
f = e.copy()
e.add(6)
print(e) #output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
print(f) #output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```
`discard()` used with sets to remove a specified element from the set,
if it is a member. If the element is not a member, discard() does 
nothing (i.e., it does not raise an error).
syntax `set.discard(element)`
```py 
h = {1, 2, 3, 4}
h.discard(1)
h.discard(7)
print(h) #output: {2, 3, 4}
```
the 7 in the line `h.discard(7)` is not in the set , though 
the print doesn't through error , unlike the remove() method
`pop()` used with sets to remove and return an arbitrary element
from the set. Since sets are unordered, there’s no way to 
determine which element will be removed and returned. If the set
is empty, calling pop() will raise a KeyError.
```py 
i = {"A", True, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(i.pop()) #output: True
```
`remember` the pop() method used indexing in the array, 
but here it will get you a random element in the set
`update()` used with sets to add elements from a set 
(or any iterable) to another set. It modifies the set
on which it’s called by adding elements from the iterable
passed to it. The elements added are those that are not 
already present in the set, ensuring the unique property 
of set elements is maintained.
syntax: `set.update(iterable)` 
```py 
j={1,2,13}
k ={1, "A", "B", 2}
j.update(["Html", "Css"])
j.update(k)
print(j) #output: {1, 2, 'A', 13, 'Html', 'Css', 'B'}
```
# what is the meaning of iterable?
Typically, it refers to a collection of elements that
can be looped over using a loop, like a for loop.
`An iterable` in Python refers to anything that contains a 
sequence of items that you can loop through. The term “iterable” 
is a broad category that encompasses various data structures 
which allow iteration over their elements. Examples include:
	1.	Lists: An ordered collection of items which can be of varying types.
	2.	Tuples: Similar to lists, but immutable (unchangeable once created).
	3.	Strings: A sequence of characters; each character can be iterated over.
	4.	Dictionaries: Collections of key-value pairs; you can iterate over the keys, values, or both.
	5.	Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.

`Non-iterable objects` on the other hand, are those that don’t hold 
a sequence of items, such as individual numbers (integers, floats) 
or boolean values. They don’t support iteration since there’s no 
sequence of elements to iterate over.

`difference()` what is in {a} that's not in {b}? 
```py 
a={11,2,3,4}
b = {1, 2, "Osama", "Ahmed"}
print(a) #output: {11, 2, 3, 4}
print(a.difference(b)) # a - b #output: {3, 11, 4}
print(a) #output: {11, 2, 3, 4}
```

`print("=" * 40) # Separator`

`difference_update()` The difference_update() method in Python is used with sets to remove 
all elements from a set that are also included in another set or iterable. After using this method, 
the set on which it is called is modified in place, meaning that it no longer contains the elements 
that were found in the other set.
```py 
c = {1, 2, 3, 4}
d = {1, 2, 3, "Osama", "Ahmed"}
print(c) #output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
c.difference_update(d) # c - d
print(c) #output: {4} 
```
`intersection()` what is common between the first set and the other set? 
```py 
e = {1, 2, 3, 4, "X"}
f = {"Osama", "X", 2}
print(e) #output: {'X', 1, 2, 3, 4}
print(e.intersection(f)) # e & f
print(e) #output: {'X', 1, 2, 3, 4}
```
`intersection_update()` 
syntax: `set.intersection_update(iterable)` 
    • set is the set that will be updated.
    • iterable can be another set, list, tuple, or any iterable object.
```py 
e = {1, 2, 3, 4, "X"}
f = {"Osama", "X", 2}
print(e)  # This prints the original set e before the intersection update #output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 'X'}
e.intersection_update(f)  # Modifies e to be the intersection of e and f
print(e.intersection_update(f))  # This is effectively calling print(None) #output: None
print(e)  # This prints the modified set e after the intersection update #output: {'X', 2}
```
//but what if i want just the objects that is not repeated in both sets?  # the opposite//
`symmetric_difference()` used with sets to return a new set that contains all elements from both sets, but not the elements that are common to both. In other words, it returns the set of all elements in either of the two sets, excluding the elements that are common in both.
syntax `setA.symmetric_difference(setB)`
```py 
i = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "X"}
j = {"Osama", "Zero", 1, 2, 4}
print(i) #output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'X'}
print(i. symmetric_difference(j)) #output: {3, 5, 'Osama', 'X', 'Zero'}
print(i) #output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'X'}
```
`symmetric_difference_update()` used with sets to update the set by keeping
only the elements found in either set, but not in both. In other words, 
it modifies the set upon which it’s called to contain only elements 
that are in either of the sets, excluding the elements that are common to both.
```py 
i = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "X"}
j = {"Osama", "Zero", 1, 2, 4}
print(i) #output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'X'}
print(i.symmetric_difference_update(j)) #output: None
print(i) #output: {3, 5, 'X', 'Zero', 'Osama'}
```
`issuperset()` if i have two sets and i want to check if all of 
the second list is included in the first one
```py 
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
b = {1, 2, 3}
c = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(a.issuperset(b)) # True
print(a.issuperset(c)) # False
```
`issubset()` if i want to check the opposite ? if all of the first 
list ins included in the second one
```py 
d = {1, 2, 3, 4}
e = {1, 2, 3}
print(d.issubset(e)) # False
```
`isdisjoint()` if i just want to know if the two sets have nothing in common
```py 
g = {1, 2, 3, 4}
h = {1, 2, 3}
i = {10, 11, 12}
print(g.isdisjoint(h)) # False
print(g.isdisjoint(i)) # True
```
