# list (array) = [1, 2, 3, 4]
does the same job as the array in other languages 
    [1] List Items Are Enclosed in Square Brackets `[]`
    [2] List Are Ordered, Use Index To Access Item
    [3] List Are Mutable => Add, Delete, Edit
    [4] List Items Is Not Unique
    [5] List Can Have Different Data Types

# List Methods
`append()` means add something to a list. 
```py 
myFriends = ["Osama", "Ahmed", "Sayed"] 
myFriends. append ("Alaa") 
myFriends.append (100) 
myFriends.append (150.200) 
myFriends.append(True)
print(myFriends) #output: ['Osama', 'Ahmed', 'Sayed', 'Alaa', 100, 150.2, True]
```
if i added another list and used `append ()`
```py 
myFriends = ["Osama", "Ahmed", "Sayed"] 
myOldFriends = ["Haytham", "Samah", "Ali"]
myFriends.append ("Alaa") 
myFriends.append (100) 
myFriends.append (150.200) 
myFriends.append(True)
myFriends.append(myOldFriends)
print(myFriends) #output: ['Osama', 'Ahmed', 'Sayed', 'Alaa', 100, 150.2, True, ['Haytham', 'Samah', 'Ali']]
```
but what if i want to access Samah or Ali ? 
```py 
myFriends = ["Osama", "Ahmed", "Sayed"] 
myOldFriends = ["Haytham", "Samah", "Ali"]
myFriends. append ("Alaa") 
myFriends.append (100) 
myFriends.append (150.200) 
myFriends.append(True)
myFriends.append(myOldFriends)
print (myFriends[2]) # output: Sayed
print(myFriends[6]) # output: True
print(myFriends[7]) # output: ['Haytham', 'Samah', 'Ali']
print(myFriends[7][2]) # output: Ali
```
but what if i want to extend the "myOldFirends" list so that it's not treated as single element
 and treated as a part of the original list? we will use `extend()`
`extend()` used to add all the elements of an iterable (like list, tuple, string, etc.) 
to the end of the list.
    • The extend() method modifies the original list. It doesn’t return a new list; instead, 
    it directly adds the elements to the list calling the method.
	• It can add elements of any iterable (like another list, tuple, set, or string). 
    If a string is passed as an iterable, each character in the string will be added as an individual element.
	•It is different from the append() method. While append() adds its argument as a single element
     to the end of the list, extend() adds each element of the iterable individually.
```py 
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
b = ["A", "B", "c"] 
a. extend (b) 
print(a) #output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 'A', 'B', 'c']
```
`remove()` used to remove the first occurrence of a specified value from a list. If the value
is not present in the list, it raises a ValueError.
Here’s the basic syntax:
`list.remove(value)`
	• list is the list from which you want to remove an element.
	• value is the element you want to remove from the list.
```py 
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3]
my_list.remove(3)
print(my_list) #output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]
```
This will output [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]. The first occurrence of the value 3 is removed from the list.
	• Only the first occurrence of the specified value is removed. If the value appears multiple 
    times in the list, you would need to call remove() repeatedly to remove all occurrences.
	• If the value is not in the list, Python raises a ValueError. Therefore, it’s often wise to 
    check whether the value exists in the list before attempting to remove it.
	• The remove() method does not return any value (returns None).
`sort()` the sort() can only sort out numbers or strings but not both in the same list 
```py 
y = [1, 2, 100, 120, -10, 17, 29]
y.sort()
print(y) #output: [-10, 1, 2, 17, 29, 100, 120]
```
to reverse the sorting we use the True value cuz it's False by default
```py 
y = [1, 2, 100, 120, -10, 17, 29]
y.sort(reverse=True)
print(y) #output: [120, 100, 29, 17, 2, 1, -10]
```
`reverse()` used to reverse the elements of a list in place
```py 
z= [10, 1, 9, 80, 100, "Osama", 100]
z.reverse() 
print(z) #output: [100, 'Osama', 100, 80, 9, 1, 10]
```
`clear()` Remove all items from list. let's say clear shopping list from website
```py 
a=[1, 2, 3, 4]
a.clear()
print(a) #output: []
```
`copy()` shallow copy and deep copy
```py 
b= [1,2,3,4]
c = b.copy()
b.append(5)
print(b) #output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(c) #output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
	• Shallow Copy `copy()`: Creates a new object, but fills it with references to the items 
    contained in the original object. Useful if you want to create a new list sharing the same sub-objects.
	• Deep Copy `deepcopy()`: Creates a new object, and recursively copies all objects found in the original,
     creating new independent objects. This is useful when the list contains complex, mutable objects like lists,
      dictionaries, custom objects, etc.
`count()` used to count the number of occurrences of a specified element in a list (or more generally, 
in any iterable like a tuple or string).
basic syntax: `list.count(element)`
```py 
d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 9, 10, 1, 2, 1]
print(d.count (1)) #output: 3
```
`index()` used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a list. 
If the value is not present in the list, it raises a ValueError.
basic syntax: `list.index(element, start, end)`
```py 
e= ["Osama", "Ahmed", "Sayed", "Ramy", "Ahmed", "Ramy"]
print(e. index("Ramy")) #output: 3
```
`insert()` same as `append()` but append puts the object in the last while insert let's you index and insert
```py 
f = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "A", "B"]
f.insert(0, "Test")
print(f) #output: ['Test', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'A', 'B']
```
`pop(index) - pop()` return item at index 
```py 
g = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "A", "B"]
print(g.pop(2)) #output: 3
```
