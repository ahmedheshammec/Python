# # User Input
if we type: `input("Hello Python")` the terminal will give you something to write
example: 
```py 
fName = input('What\'s Is Your First Name?')
mName = input('What\'s Is Your Middle Name?')
lName = input('What\'s Is Your Last Name?')
print(f"Hello {fName} {mName} {lName} Happy To See You") # Hello ahmed hesham mohamed Happy To See You
```
::**Note**:: remember we escaped the single quote by using the backslash /
when you run this the terminal will ask you the 3 questions and after that 
it will collect the data you put in the input and say happy to see you.
in order to enhance this: we need to remove the spaces that we type when 
we input the names, to do that we will use the strip() method
`print(f"Hello {fName.strip()} {mName.strip()} {lName.strip()} Happy To See You")`
now, let's control the input style, let's say we want to make it capitalized (Ahmed) 
so no one can type (AHMeD) or something like this, we will use the chain method 
in order to chain the methods of strip, capitalize, etc. 
```py 
fName = input('What\'s Is Your First Name?')
mName = input('What\'s Is Your Middle Name?')
lName = input('What\'s Is Your Last Name?')
fName = fName.strip().capitalize()
mName = mName.strip().capitalize()
lName = lName.strip().capitalize()
print(f"Hello {fName} {mName} {lName} Happy To See You") # Hello Ahmed Hesham Mohamed Happy To See You
```
now what if we want the take only the first letter of the second name? we will use truncate
```py 
fName = input('What\'s Is Your First Name?')
mName = input('What\'s Is Your Middle Name?')
lName = input('What\'s Is Your Last Name?')
fName = fName.strip().capitalize()
mName = mName.strip().capitalize()
lName = lName.strip().capitalize()
print(f"Hello {fName} {mName:.1s} {lName} Happy To See You")
```
<!-- output -->
`Hello Ahmed H Mohamed Happy To See You`

### Practical Email Slicing
we want to slice the email by the @ sign, from the start to the @ sign and after the sign
```py 
email = "Osama_Elzero@elzero.org" # print(email[0:5]) # normal slicing #output: 12
print(email.index("@")) #take that index and tell it to start from the beginning #output: Osama_Elzero
print(email[0:email.index("@")])
```
we can also delete the 0 cuz if we left it blank it will start from the beginning anyway. 
:: **Example** ::
``` py
theName = input('What\'s Your Name ?')
theEmail = input('What\'s Your Email ?')
theUsername = theEmail[:theEmail.index("@")]
theWebsite = theEmail[theEmail.index("@"):]
print(f"Hello {theName} Your Email Is {theEmail}") #output: Hello ahmed Your Email Is ahmed.hesham8728@gmail.com
print (f"Your Username Is {theUsername} and Your Website Is {theWebsite}") #output: Your Username Is ahmed.hesham8728 and Your Website Is @gmail.com
```
when i print this the website will include the @ and i don't want that, to fix this: we will add +1 to the code
```py 
theName = input('What\'s Your Name ?')
theEmail = input('What\'s Your Email ?')
theUsername = theEmail[:theEmail.index("@")]
theWebsite = theEmail[theEmail.index("@")+1:]
print(f"Hello {theName} Your Email Is {theEmail}")
print (f"Your Username Is {theUsername} and Your Website Is {theWebsite}")
```
<!-- output -->
`Your Username Is ahmed.hesham8728 and Your Website Is gmail.com`
now the only thing left is to srtip() and to capitalize
```py 
theName = input('What\'s Your Name ?').strip().capitalize()
theEmail = input('What\'s Your Email ?').strip()
theUsername = theEmail[:theEmail.index("@")]
theWebsite = theEmail[theEmail.index("@")+1:]
print(f"Hello {theName} Your Email Is {theEmail}")
print (f"Your Username Is {theUsername} \nYour Website Is {theWebsite}")
```
<!-- output -->
Hello Ahmed Your Email Is ahmed.hesham8728@gmail.com
Your Username Is ahmed.hesham8728 
Your Website Is gmail.com

#### Practical Your Age Full Details
when you ask the user to input the age, we want to make sure the type in int not str 
```py 
# age = input('What\'s Your Age ?').strip() #normal input
age = int(input('What\'s Your Age ?').strip()) #putting input inside int
print(age) #output: 29
print(type(age)) #output: <class 'int'>
```
:: **now let's make the app** ::
```py 
age = int(input('What\'s Your Age ?').strip())
months = age * 12
weeks = months * 4
days = age * 365
hours = days * 24
minutes = hours * 60
seconds = minutes * 60
print ('You Lived For:') #output: You Lived For:
print(f"{months} Months.") #output: 348 Months.
print(f"{weeks:,} Weeks.") #output: 1,392 Weeks.
print(f"{days:,} Days.") #output: 10,585 Days.
print(f"{hours:,} Hours.") #output: 254,040 Hours.
print(f"{minutes:,} Minutes.") #output: 15,242,400 Minutes.
print(f"{seconds:,} Seconds.") #output: 914,544,000 Seconds.
```
::**Note**::: the `{:,}` is to put the increment after 3 digits
